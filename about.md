I’m an [Umbraco MVP](https://community.umbraco.com/mvp-program/mvp-archive/){:target="_blank"} and [Umbraco Certified Master](https://umbraco.com/training/certified-developers/developer/?uid=38091){:target="_blank"}, and a creative problem-solver with a passion for building and improving digital experiences. My work spans across quality assurance, web development, accessibility, and community engagement, all centered around helping teams deliver meaningful, well-crafted solutions.

I thrive in roles where I can blend organization, curiosity, and collaboration, whether that’s leading QA efforts, developing with Umbraco, shaping user documentation, or mentoring others through talks and guides. I enjoy working at the intersection of people and process, turning complex ideas into clear, actionable outcomes that strengthen both technology and teams.

Above all, I love to learn, share, and contribute, especially in spaces where open source, accessibility, and thoughtful design come together.

## I love Umbraco

I devote much of my free time to the open-source community through speaking engagements, blog writing, code contributions, and event planning. Most recently, I've joined the community team board that organizes the annual Umbraco US Festival.

## I am a Notion nerd

I love Notion almost as much as I love Umbraco. If you're not familiar with Notion, I'd be delighted to tell you about it! Organization is my passion, and it shows in everything I do. Like any skill worth mastering, organization is an evolving practice that can always be refined and improved.

## I am always learning

Whether it's a Codecademy course or an in-person course at my local community college, I am always taking time to play with new technologies to see how things work. I actively ask questions, a lot of them, which helps me gain a better understanding of how things work. I regularly code proof of concepts and build projects just for fun to keep up-to-date and experiment with the latest features. This hands-on approach allows me to stay current with emerging technologies while satisfying my curiosity through practical application.

## I love to share

I've blogged, created documentation, and participate actively in conferences and discussions to share experiences and learn from peers. Most recently, I've joined the Umbraco US Foundation board that organizes the annual Umbraco US Festival, furthering my commitment to knowledge sharing in the community.

## I love to read

I love to read whenever I can make the time. eBooks and audiobooks are my jam! My favorite genres include fiction, fantasy, romance, and the occasional non-fiction—especially productivity books and works about technology's impact on society and the psychology of addictive tech.
